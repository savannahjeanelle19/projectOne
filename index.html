            <h1> About Me </h1>

            <p> My name is Savannah Dunlap and I'm a senior here at EWU, studying Visual Communication Design. I love movies, animals (especially dogs), history, and art. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend of almost 3 years, a roommate, and our cat Mabel. I'm from Olympia, where my parents, older sister, and 2 dogs still reside. </p>

            <h2> Goals and Aspirations
            </h2>
            <p> My main goal is to just be happy; I haven't really figured out my career goals at this point. I honestly just want to try a lot of things out and have some good experiences before I settle on something perfect. Ideally, I would really like to work in the film industry and I even want to try my hand at special effects makeup.

             <p> My favorite book is 1984 (I know, a book I read for high school, lame). I really enjoy novels set in the future along with science fiction. I was just so fascinated with the grim, controlled world it describes and I could not put it down.</p>

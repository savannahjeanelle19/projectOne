            <h1> About Me </h1>

            <p> My name is Savannah Dunlap and I'm a senior here at EWU, studying Visual Communication Design. I love movies, animals (especially dogs), history, and art. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend of almost 3 years, a roommate, and our cat Mabel. I'm from Olympia, where my parents, older sister, and 2 dogs still reside. </p>

            <h2> Goals and Aspirations
            </h2>
                <p> My main goal is to just be happy; I haven't really figured out my career goals at this point. I honestly just want to try a lot of things out and have some good experiences before I settle on something perfect. Ideally, I would really like to work in the film industry and I even want to try my hand at special effects makeup.

             <h2 class=book> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1984-Signet-Classics-George-Orwell/dp/0451524934/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476049094&sr=8-1&keywords=1984"> My Favorite Book</a></h2>
                 <p> My favorite book is 1984 (I know, a book I read for high school, lame). I really enjoy novels set in the future along with science fiction. I was just so fascinated with the grim, controlled world it describes and I could not put it down.</p>
             <h2> My Favorite Meals</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li> Banana Cream Pie<br> <img class="pie"src="http://cdn1.aspicyperspective.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_67893.jpg"/ <br> <p> I love all pies, but something about banana and about a metric ton of whipped cream really does it for me.</p> </li>
                 <li> Pizza <br> <img class="pizza"src="https://media.timeout.com/images/102421929/image.jpg" <br> <p> I know this is unoriginal, but who doesn't love pizza? I personally love Italian style pizza, with a thin, slightly charred crust and lots of fresh basil. Dominos is good too, though.</p> </li>
                 <li>Nachos <br> <img class="nachos"src="http://www.tacobueno.com/media/1378/muchonacholarge.png?quality=65" <br> <p> Nacho cheese will be the death of me. The cheaper and more unhealthy, the better. I crave Taco Bell almost 24/7.</p></li>
